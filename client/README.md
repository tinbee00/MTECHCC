#Assignment 1: PHP Application Development

###Use HTML, CSS and PHP to
develop a Client webpage which should accept user input data, send the data to
a server page and receive information as response from the server. The Client
should display the received information. Save the page as client.php. You can
include items such as drop-down menus, check boxes, option buttons, a form, text
boxes, labels, command buttons and many more in your form(s). Make good use of
CSS.



###Use PHP to develop the
Server page that should receive data from the client and also reply the client
with some information from a MySQL database. Save the page as server.php. Other
necessary php files may be added. A database must be used.

*Use an API*. You can modify the provided REST API
template files to develop your application.

Deploy the application in a project/repository on Github.

To start the application, go the project folder and type

*php -S localhost:8000*

This project uses bootstrap-3.4.1
